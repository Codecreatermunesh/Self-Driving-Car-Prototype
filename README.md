# Self-driving Car
# This is the Innovation and Design Lab Project, IIT Patna,  under Dr. Rajiv Mishra(HOD of the CSE Department).
# This  Project was developed by Munesh Meena(computer science Engineering) and Ashutosh Kumar(Artificial Intelligence).
This project developed a self-driving car prototype that demonstrates lane tracking, automated parking, obstacle detection, and traffic light detection.

The project aims to build a monocular vision using Raspberry Pi as a processing chip. A Pi camera and an ultrasonic sensor are used to provide necessary data from the real world to the module. The proposed module helps the driver reach the given destination safely and intelligently, thus avoiding the risk of human errors. Many existing algorithms like  Obstacle detection, Traffic signal detection, Automatic parking, and Lane tracking are combined to provide the necessary control to the car. Ultrasonic sensors carry out obstacle detection and Automatic parking. Lane Tracking and Traffic signal detection are done with the help of a Pi camera along with OpenCV. 

 A miniature car with the above features will be developed to show optimum performance in the simulated environment because all assumptions and Dependencies are met.
